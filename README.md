- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) account for API token

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://cargo-tracker-backend-jhy2.onrender.com/api
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
```

### Installation Options

#### Standard Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anuj-er/cargo-tracker-webapp.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cargo-tracker-webapp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

#### Docker Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anuj-er/cargo-tracker-webapp.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cargo-tracker-webapp

# Create .env file with required environment variables
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=https://cargo-tracker-backend-jhy2.onrender.com/api" > .env
echo "REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token" >> .env

# Make the deploy script executable
chmod +x docker-deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script
./docker-deploy.sh
```

- Quick status overview
- Create new shipment button

### Map View
- Interactive map showing shipment routes
- Current location markers
- Route visualization
- ETA display

### Shipment Management

- Track shipment status

## ü§ù Integration with Backend

The frontend communicates with the backend API using the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/shipments` | GET | Retrieve all shipments |
| `/api/shipments/:id` | GET | Get specific shipment details |
| `/api/shipments/:id/update-location` | POST | Update shipment location |
| `/api/shipments/:id/eta` | GET | Get estimated arrival time |
| `/api/shipments` | POST | Create a new shipment |

## üê≥ Docker Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build and start the container (uses docker-compose.yml)
docker-compose up -d --build

# Alternative: Run the deploy script
./docker-deploy.sh
```

### Monitoring and Management
```bash
# View running containers
docker ps

# View container logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs -f webapp

# Check container health
docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}"
```

### Stopping and Cleaning Up
```bash
# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Stop containers and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Remove all stopped containers, unused networks, images and volumes
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

### Rebuilding After Changes
```bash
# Rebuild the application after code changes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure build settings (automatic)
3. Add environment variables (REACT_APP_API_URL, REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN)

## üìù Assumptions

- Users have basic knowledge of shipping logistics
- The backend API is accessible at the specified URL
- Mapbox is used for map visualization
- Each shipment has a unique ID and container ID
- Location updates may be manual or automated
- Authentication is handled separately or will be implemented in future versions
